# Drone Simulator 3D

* A 3D drone simulation
* Pilot a virtual drone and explore the 3D environment
* Debug view mode, AI drone, physics and collisions
* Easily moddable using OBJ format, GLSL vert/frag shaders and image textures
* Made with openGL 3.2 and C++11

## Setup

* Recommended: Visual Studio 2017
* Download VS2017 project source
* Unzip and open DroneGame1.vcxproj
* Run with "Local Windows Debugger" in release mode (or debug mode)

## Instructions To Use

* See my technical report <a href="https://github.com/iamhaker23/portfolio/blob/master/drone_simulation_3d/graphics_2_technical_report_WORDPRESS.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

* Keyboard controls:

| Action | Key(s) |
| --- | --- |
| Movement | WASD + QE |
| Rotation | Arrows + LSHIFT + SPACE |
| Debug view | F1 |
| Hover mode (toggle) | F2 |
| Manual field-of-view (hold) | F3 |
| stop AI drone (hold) | F4 |
| FoV increase/decrease | +/- | 
| Toggle camera | Numpad 0 |
